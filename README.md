# EYRC-Luminosity-Drone-Competition

EYRC is a project competiton conducted by IIT where students can select from a bunch of themes. My team had selected the theme Luminosity drone. 
You can find the environement, installations and setup online. 
The competition hosters had provided us with setup environement, we just had to download and set it up on our device and write code for the same

led_detection.py consists of code which implements opencv on led.jpg to detect the whide dots (alien life form)


position_hold.py consists of code whicb implements ros and gazebo to stablizie the drone using PID tuning


waypoint_navigation.py consists of code to traverse the drone at various fixed locations in the environment


life_form_detection.py consists of code to traverse the drone in the environment and detect alien life form


LD_3449_biota_detector.py consists of code same as life_form_detection.py but we also had to detct the type of alien type, ie, 2 white dots means alien A, 3 white dots means alien B and so on.
